    "english": [
        "A cluttered desk often leads to a cluttered mind. Creating a well-organized workspace, whether at home or in an office, is a simple change that can dramatically boost your productivity and reduce anxiety.",
        "The physical environment directly impacts your mental state. When everything has a designated place, you spend less time searching for documents or tools, and more time focusing on your core tasks. This minimizes mental fatigue.",
        "Start by implementing the 'one in, one out' rule for office supplies and documents. If you buy a new notebook, get rid of an old one. Regularly clear your desk of anything that doesn't belong to the task you are currently working on.",
        "Consider incorporating plants or personal items that bring you joy, as long as they don't become distractions. A pleasant, clean, and functional workspace is an investment in your daily efficiency and overall job satisfaction."

        "杂乱的桌面往往会导致混乱的思绪。创建一个组织良好的工作空间，无论是在家还是在办公室，都是一个可以显著提高你的生产力和减少焦虑的简单改变。",
        "物理环境直接影响你的精神状态。当每件物品都有一个指定的存放位置时，你就会减少寻找文件或工具的时间，将更多时间集中在核心任务上。这能最大限度地减少精神疲劳。",
        "首先，对办公用品和文件实施“一进一出”的规则。如果你买了一个新笔记本，就处理掉一个旧的。定期清理桌面上所有与你当前正在处理的任务无关的物品。",
        "考虑加入能带给你快乐的植物或个人物品，只要它们不会成为干扰。一个令人愉快、干净、功能齐全的工作空间是对你日常效率和整体工作满意度的投资。"
